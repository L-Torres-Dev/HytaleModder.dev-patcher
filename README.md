# ~~Patcher~~

This ~~patcher~~ allows you to more easily prepare an environment for exploring the Hytale Server without publishing the decompiled code.

# Why?

When you add a compiled jar as a library, IntelliJ only decompiles class by class and doesn't let you search it. For example, you cannot right click some class and then Find Usages. This script will give you a ready to use Hytale server code as a project where you can explore anything you want.

## Setup

* Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

* Create a Python virtual environment in the `.venv` folder. The command for this varies by platform but it is probably 
one of these: 
  - `python -m venv .venv`
  - `python3 -m venv .venv` (Linux)
  - `py -3.13 -m venv .venv` (Windows)  

  In the last one, specifying the version is recommended if you have multiple Pythons installed.

* Activate the virtual environment:
  - Windows: `".venv\Scripts\activate"`  (including the quotes)
  - Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - From now on, you are running python commands from inside the venv, hence you must use `python` instead of `py` or `python3` to invoke python.
 
* Inside the venv, you have to install the dependencies
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Install these dependencies and ensure they are on PATH:
  - `git`
  - `java` you need JDK 25 or newer
  - `jar` (comes with JDK inside the bin folder)
  - `mvn`

### **YOU MUST HAVE THEM INSTALLED! TRY `git --version`, `mvn --version`, etc. IN THE CMD BEFORE RUNNING PYTHON CODE!**
 

## Usage

Put your HytaleServer.jar in the same root directory of this repo or specify an environment variable `HYTALESERVER_JAR_PATH` with the path to your HytaleServer.jar

Then run this:
```shell
python run.py setup
```
It will
- copy the HytaleServer.jar into `work/download`
  * (on Windows) fix `META-INF/license` name collision
- decompile it using Fernflower and save the output to `work/decompile`
- set up a Maven project in `hytale-server` with the decompiled code

You can then open the `hytale-server` folder in your favorite IDE and begin exploring the code. For *IntelliJ IDEA*,
you must first set up the SDK. After opening the project (you can open the `pom.xml` file, IDEA will prompt you to open
the entire project) press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S and under _Project_ configure SDK and Language level to *25*.

If IDEA does not offer an option to run the main file, right-click the `src` folder -> Mark Directory As -> Sources Root
then reload the maven project:  
![_readme_images/img.png](_readme_images/img.png)  
It is located in the "m" icon on the right side:  
![_readme_images/m.png](_readme_images/m.png)  
If you don't see it, enable it under View -> Tool Windows -> Maven.  
![_readme_images/tool_windows.png](_readme_images/tool_windows.png)  


This decompiled code is likely broken. But it is somewhat usable for exploration. Try Ctrl+Shift+F and search PacketAdapters
